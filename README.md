# What is this?


This is a web deployment of a Project Management application. Employers can use this application to create projects with a budget and tasks needed to be done. After a project is created, users can assign employees to projects as well as tasks to indicate who is working on what.


# What technologies are being used?


The backend is written in JavaScript using Vue.js Node.js and express.js, it is linked to a MongoDB database to store all the saved information. The frontend is written in JavaScript using HTML and CSS to style the webpages.




# Can we see the website?

Yes, the website is currently up and running at https://serene-hamlet-11849.herokuapp.com/ and is able to be used.



# What is left to implement? 

Currently, you are unable to assign staff members to a project or tasks, and in our next iteration I will implement that. However, at the moment, the website is fully operational and able to be used easily.
