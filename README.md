# Project-Management-WebandMobile

The purpose of our project will be to create a management tool that will be able to track projects. This will include members working on the project, start date, end date, and budget. The user will be able to create projects, load saved projects, update projects with new information, or delete projects.

The specific entities that would be handled with CRUD are:
Project (id, projectname, startdate, enddate, description)
Teammember (name, id, salary/hour)
Project Manager (name, id, salary/hour)
Tasks (taskName, due dates, description of things needed to be done, assigned project members)
Budget (frontEndBudget,backEndBudget as examples for coding project)
Clients (requirements, contactDetails)


The web application will be used by the project manager to create projects, assign team members, track budget, assign tasks to team members, and display general information.

Team members will be able to use the mobile application to view the tasks that they are specifically assigned to. They will also be able to input how much time and what they accomplished on a task.

Clients will be able to input new requirements from their mobile or web application, and an alert will be displayed to the project manager when this is done.
